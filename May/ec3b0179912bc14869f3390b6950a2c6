 But its just political jargon for load shedding.Seriously, Eskom? But in case you didn't know, a festival is defined as a period of joyous celebration.The only thing we celebrate when it comes to Eskom is when the lights stay on. And we can because they've stayed on for a few days in a row.But it's a tall order asking us to "celebrate" load shedding as the "maintenance festival" comes to town.How dense do you think we are you bumbling bumpkins?
