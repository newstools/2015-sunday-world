 Thousands of people were killed and millions more affected.This was the worst disaster there since the 1934 earthquake.Hopefully, with all the bad press we have been getting due to xenophobic violence, this will show the world we are a caring and compassionate people.It gives us courage knowing all is not lost.Our prayers are with the rescue teams and the people of Nepal.
